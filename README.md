# Post Install Configuration

This project aims to provide a generic and distro-agnostic post installation system configuration mechanism via [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)

As of now the, this playbook provides a very basic installation configuration for Redhat, Debian and Arch family of distros. Only the Redhat family distros (Fedora) are tested completely.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
